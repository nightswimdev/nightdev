# nightdev — Underground Edition v1.0

**A dark gateway to the web.**  
Welcome to nightdev — a low-profile, minimalist proxy built for discreet browsing and a shadowy aesthetic.

---

> Slip into the underground. nightdev gives you quiet access to the web — stripped, private, and built for night usage.

## Overview

nightdev is a compact, static web proxy and launcher with a moody, low-light UI. It’s designed for private, distraction‑free exploration of content across the net — think dimmed tones, subtle animations, and a focus on privacy-first behaviors.

## What’s New in v1.0 — Underground Edition

- 🌑 Dark, low-contrast theme optimized for night use  
- 🕶️ Cloak mode: open in about:blank with iframe loading for stealth browsing  
- ⚡ Performance & memory improvements for lightweight devices  
- 🔗 Proxy prefix/bare server controls for advanced routing  
- 🧭 Sidebar and quick-access widgets tuned for minimal exposure

## Features

- 🖤 Night-first UI — muted palettes, soft glows, and less attention  
- 🔒 Privacy-minded defaults — minimal telemetry, no tracking cookies by default  
- 🧭 Built-in proxy controls — adjust uv prefix/bare for custom setups  
- 🕯️ Cloak & Panic tools — about:blank cloak and panic key to quickly hide the site  
- 📦 Static & portable — runs anywhere static sites are hosted

## Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3 (dark design system)  
- Vanilla JavaScript — small footprint, no trackers  
- Deploy on: GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, or any static host

## Navigation

- Home (index.html)  
- Apps (apps.html)  
- AI (ai.html)  
- Settings (settings.html) — contains cloak, panic key, proxy controls

## Quick Start

```bash
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-org/nightdev.git

# open locally
cd nightdev
start index.html   # Windows: opens default browser
```

## Security & Privacy Notes

- nightdev ships with conservative defaults; IPs and basic usage may be logged for abuse protection.  
- Use cloak/about:blank and the panic key for an extra layer of on-screen discretion.  
- This is a static frontend; if you deploy with a proxy backend, review backend logging and policies.
